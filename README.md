## Turbulence in celestial bodies

# Description

This repository generates statistical inferences from artificially created astronomy data. The celestial landscape is conprised of several features such as stars, planets, meteoroids, etc. Using statistical methods to classify these objects in space, is useful for extraplanetary research and identifying new planets and stars etc at different frequencies. The notebooks describe the funtions used and the code dependencies.
